# SDK version 3.0

## Simplified region interaction
Interacting with the region ID and setting it accordingly has been greatly simplified, so now thereâ€™s less to setup to get it to work.

## Simplified frequency setting
Setting frequency is much easier than before, it internalizes the frequency validation process (although one can validate frequency data manually too) and provides a higher level interface that makes the subsystem far simpler to interact with.

## Improved frequency validations
Internally there are deeper checks on the integrity of frequency data, ensuring appropriate bounds to the frequency setting functionality.

## Huge bug fixes
Time since the last release has allowed for a vast amount of bug fixes in the code base.

## Improved framework stability
The stability of the framework is increased greatly, and much logic has been overhauled for more coherent internal flows.

## V1 deprecation
Mesh and Pro are the only candidates for use in this SDK version, V1 is no longer supported from this point.

* Take a look a the README.md to learn more and to see a few important notes on the SDK changes.
